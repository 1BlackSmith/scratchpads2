What makes a good logo?
-----------------------

It's not easy to design a custom logo. Some guidelines to consider:

- Try to keep it relatively small so the header area is not too big. The header appears on every page and site content is displayed below the header.
- The dimensions of the default Scratchpad logo are 71x70 pixels. We do not recommend creating a logo over 130 pixels high.
- The ideal file format is [Portable Network Graphics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) (PNG) as it supports transparency, something that JPEGs do not. If your header image/logo does not require transparent areas then a JPEG is fine to use.
- We create logos as [vector images](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_image) then save them as [raster images](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics).
