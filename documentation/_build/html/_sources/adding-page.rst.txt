3. Enter a *TITLE*, e.g. “Introduction”, and some *BODY* text. The
   *SUMMARY* field can be used for a short version that is displayed on
   search results or news pages

4. Use the *MEDIA* field to link media (images, audio or video) to your
   page. These items will appear as links beneath the text of your page

5. To add images to your text, you need to add them using the *Add
   media* icon in the *BODY* field

6. In *MENU SETTINGS* select where you want the page to be placed by choosing the appropriate *PARENT ITEM*.

By default, a page will be set to Main menu (see above). A *MENU LINK TITLE* is required for each page. By default, the page title is used. You may want to replace the menu link if the page title is very long

It is not advisable to have all pages showing up in the Main menu, so before you add pages think about the hierarchy of menu items and start adding the pages that should show in the main menu first.

The *WEIGHT* defines where in a list of menu items this item is placed.

7. Click the *Save* button at the bottom left

Editing page
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To edit an existing page you can either click the edit tab on the page, or find the page in the *admin>content>page* section.

1. Edit content on the page by clicking the *Edit* tab
2. The *BODY* field has a Rich text editor. Explore some of the features of the rich text editor by modifying the format of the text you have entered
3. Click *Save*


Cloning a page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For cases where there are only slight differences between nodes you can
create a duplicate:

1. Click on the *Clone* tab.
2. Change the *Title* of the page and some of the text
3. Change the menu link


Hierarchical pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often, it's useful to create a hierchical structure of pages.

1. Create a new page
2. In *MENU SETTINGS* select a previously created page as the *PARENT ITEM*.

3. Click *Save*

Instead of popping up in the Main menu, the menu link title now appears in a block next to the page. This block will fill with a hierarchy of menu items as you add more pages. You can use it to structure your pages in a way that helps users to find the information.
